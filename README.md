I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple AWS S3 Bucket file uploader/downloader

To use this tool you'll need to supply your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key and the S3 Bucket.

All supported regions as of March 5, 2025 but you can add more in main.py.

You can even drag-and-drop any file to the UI and it will upload to a bucket.

Best Regards,<br/>
