I'm still learning Python and using these as reference guides for any employment opportunities and future projects.

This is a simple AWS S3 Bucket file uploader/downloader

To use this tool you'll need to supply your AWS Access Key, Secret Access Key and the S3 Bucket. </br>
At the moment only four regions are supported; "us-east-1 (N. Virginia)", "us-east-2 (Ohio)", "ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)", "ap-northeast-2 (Seoul)", you can add more regions in the main.py in lines 20-23, the format is specific, only the AWS region name is used, the text after the space are ignored and only used for the UI.

Best Regards,<br/>
Brian
